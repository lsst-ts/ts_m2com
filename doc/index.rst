.. _Overview:

Overview
========

This module contains the common code for the main telescope M2 commandable SAL component (CSC) and graphical user interface (GUI) to operate the M2 mirror control system.
The `eups <https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/eups>`_ is used as the package manager.
This package also supports the `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest>`_ package manager.

The badges above navigate to the GitHub repository for the common code and Jira issues.

Dependencies
============

* `ts_salobj <https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_salobj>`_
* `ts_tcpip <https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tcpip>`_
* `ts_utils <https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_utils>`_

.. _JSON_String:

JSON String
===========

The `JSON <https://www.json.org>`_ string is used in the TCP/IP communication between the M2 CSC/GUI and hardware.
The design here takes the following documents as references: `TS JSON Message Format Proposal <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LTS/TS+JSON+Message+Format+Proposal>`_ and `TS JSON Message Format Proposal <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LTS/TS+JSON+Message+Format+Proposal>`_.

The classes in module are listed below.

.. uml:: uml/class.uml
    :caption: Class diagram of M2 common code

* **Controller** has the business logic to communicate with hardware by TCP/IP interface.
* **TcpClient** is a TCP/IP client.
* **MockServer** is a mock server of M2 to support the simulation mode.
* **MockModel** simulates the hardware behavior to be used by **MockServer**.
* **MockCommand** simulates the execution of command in real hardware.
* **MockMessageEvent** simulates the message of event from real hardware.
* **MockMessageTelemetry** simulates the message of telemetry from real hardware.
